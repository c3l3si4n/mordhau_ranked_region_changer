# mordhau_ranked_region_changer
A simple Windows/PyInstaller program that changes MORDHAU's matchmaking region. This is made for Brazilian MORDHAU players who want to play ranked 1v1 or 3v3 but can't stand the high latency of MatchMaking automatically picking NA servers.


# How to use
All you need to do is open the script before, and then open MORDHAU later.
You can run the python script available on this repository, by doing `python3 main.py`. Otherwise, just download and run the available exe file on the releases section. https://github.com/c3l3si4n/mordhau_ranked_region_changer/releases/


# Troubleshooting
You might have to run the program twice before opening MORDHAU if you have never used this script before.
